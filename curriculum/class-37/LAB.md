  * one will represent a parent schema, and the other will represent a children schema.
* Both the parent and the children reducer should support creation, deletion, and update.
* You are in full control of the properties these schemas will contain. However, it is recommended that you include an unique id.
* Export a main reducer that combines both the parent and the children reducer
* Connect your store to dev tools

### Stretch Goals
